## Overview

**ProtonMODâ€‘Next** is an **actively developed experimental branch** of the ProtonVPN Android client.  
It is designed for regions with heavy network restrictions and introduces:

- Transparent **VLESS proxy integration** (via Xray)
- **Suppression of GuestHole** (preâ€‘login VPN tunnel)
- **Suppression of Autoâ€‘connect on process restore**
- Retained **certificate pinning** for full endâ€‘toâ€‘end security

New features are being added **gradually** as development continues.

## Key Modifications

- **VLESS Proxy Integration**  
  Proton API traffic (login, IP retrieval, account checks) is routed through a local VLESS proxy (Xray).  
  Implemented via a custom `ProxySelector` that applies only to Proton API hosts.

- **GuestHole Disabled**  
  The builtâ€‘in GuestHole mechanism (preâ€‘login VPN tunnel) has been suppressed.  
  This avoids unnecessary VPN attempts in blocked regions.

- **Autoâ€‘Connect Suppression**  
  Automatic VPN connection on process restore (`ConnectTrigger.Auto`) has been disabled.  
  This prevents unwanted VPN sessions before login.

- **Security Preserved**  
  TLS certificate pinning remains intact. Proton servers are still verified against their original pinned certificates.

## Build Instructions

Clone the repository and build with Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew assembleProductionVanillaOpenSourceDebug
---
### Android Studio

1. Open **Android Studio** (latest stable version recommended).  
2. Select **File â†’ Openâ€¦** and choose the root folder of this repository.  
3. Let Gradle sync the project (first sync may take a few minutes).  
4. In the toolbar, select the build variant:  
   - `productionVanillaOpenSourceDebug` for development builds  
   - `productionVanillaOpenSourceRelease` for release builds  
5. Press **Run â–¶** to install on a connected device or emulator.  

You can also use **Build â†’ Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** to generate APKs directly from the IDE.

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Active Development**  
This project is under continuous development.  
New features and improvements are added step by step, with a focus on:

- Proxy integration refinements  
- Build system optimizations  
- Documentation and reproducibility

## Roadmap

- [x] Integrate VLESS proxy into Proton API requests  
- [x] Suppress GuestHole (preâ€‘login VPN tunnel)  
- [x] Suppress Autoâ€‘connect on process restore  
- [ ] UI integration during login  
- [ ] Disable proxy when not required  

*(More items will be added as development progresses.)*
